              at this location had the tenth anniversary in 2011. The business
              had the seeds back in 1995 when Adrian negotiated long hours of
              professional bassoon player routine with his passion for bikes. It
              started with putting together bikes for close relative, friends
              and one by one by word of the mouth the customer base was formed.
              It became one moment when his garage was no longer enough - the
              car was on the street for long time then - and the first store was
              open at.... It stayed there only for one season, the space became
              again not enough for what Adi had in mind and for how the business
              progressed. The move into the current space was a thrill on
              multiple counts. Excitement, plenty of work to do, nights into
              early morning with a highly educated and reasonable skilled team -
              a musician and two software engineers - building the counter,
              raising walls, mounting doors and AC, painting, moving and
              mounting inventory. Shorty after opening the store, Adi's father
              retired from his job as driver for the German Ambassador in
              Romania and joined Adi in his endeavor. You may guess his
              struggles at the very beginning when neither German nor Romanian
              or Italian were of too much help dealing with the customers... You
              should check it now, let aside the accent you will be delighted to
              discuss with him from bicycles to soccer European tournament.
              Close friends have their share of fun with the daily routine of
              the father and son, who does not know the fight between the parent
              wanting to give advices and he son filtering quite radical the
              input and doing to his best. You will surely appreciate this
              unusual team, two generation that get together well through the
              deep passion for bicycles.

            <h2>Adi</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Adi came into US for his Master of Arts at BU as bassoon player.
              He started working at a bike shop immediately after starting the
              school, his first visit at the store was also his first interview,
              one very unusual because the job offer was made without him
              asking. The owner who was in the store and by chance was the
              person Adi was targeting with his questions was fascinated by his
              knowledge and enthusiasm. You may guess how a foreign born
              student, even with English learned in school may face a customer
              exposed job in a bicycle store. However, a high percentage of the
              customers from that time are either friends or regular visitors
              even in these days. Adrian finished his master and has a fruitful
              career in music, worked for five years as principal bassoonist at
              the Mexico City National Orchestra, teaches on a regular basis and
              has concerts few times a week with the mandatory daily routine
              professional musicians needs to respect to keep their skills.
              Later, two wonderful daughters are competing for his care and
              dedication and I guess this time is the most intensive of his own
              life to this moment. And this to both extents, taking toll of his
              energy and having the most possible sense of fulfillment. The
              permanent competing priorities shaped Adrian's personality and he
              had the energy to stay on top. If you see him handling a bike or
              building the enthusiasm of an hesitating customer you will have a
              glimpse of the intensity his internal engine is running. Adi is
              speaking easily English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and, if I am
              not mistaken, French

            <p class="lead">
              You need to get close to see the real man behind the polite but
              restrained individual contrasting apparently with Adi's
              exuberance. You don't guess it but if you enter the store you will
              address him whatever question drove you in. And you will have the
              answer. In a heavy East European accent with German flavor, funny
              but with no challenges of understanding what he has to say. As a
              newcomer, you will miss the chance to see the funny side of him.
              Most common you will not witness an argument between the too,
              never serious but that kind who will delight close friends. The
              son full of enthusiasm, initiative, pushing forward, the father
              playing the skeptical, just for fun because in fact he is the
              first admirer of Adi's vitality. Val worked for more than 30 years
              as driver for the German Embassy in Romania, being highly
              professional in a very narrow niche. He had the job due to two
              rare qualities, inspiring trust and his easiness to learn a
              foreign language. If you ever tried to learn German you will have
              the right picture. Val may claim from time to time he would rather
              enjoy a glass of wine in a lazy afternoon, but in reality he doing
              something all the time. He is the person Adi needs and he would
              hardly find. Somebody to trust with both, competency and good
              will.
