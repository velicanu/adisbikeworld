            Dear customers,
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to let you know that we still have Hybrids/City Bikes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under $1000, good size options and prices are very reasonable. All
            our bikes come with 2 year warranty and the first tune up free.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best reccomendation is for you to come and test ride the bikes,
            as the inventory is very fluid and bikes sell extremely fast, we
            cannot post the photos of the bikes available.
          </p>
