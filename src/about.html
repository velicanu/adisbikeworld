            <strong style="color: red;">Adi's Bike World</strong>
            at this location had the tenth anniversary in 2011. The business had
            the seeds back in 1995 when Adrian negotiated long hours of
            professional bassoon player routine with his passion for bikes. It
            started with putting together bikes for close relative, friends and
            one by one by word of the mouth the customer base was formed. It
            became one moment when his garage was no longer enough - the car was
            on the street for long time then - and the first store was open
            at.... It stayed there only for one season, the space became again
            not enough for what Adi had in mind and for how the business
            progressed. The move into the current space was a thrill on multiple
            counts. Excitement, plenty of work to do, nights into early morning
            with a highly educated and reasonable skilled team - a musician and
            two software engineers - building the counter, raising walls,
            mounting doors and AC, painting, moving and mounting inventory.
            Shorty after opening the store, Adi's father retired from his job as
            driver for the German Ambassador in Romania and joined Adi in his
            endeavor. You may guess his struggles at the very beginning when
            neither German nor Romanian or Italian were of too much help dealing
            with the customers... You should check it now, let aside the accent
            you will be delighted to discuss with him from bicycles to soccer
            European tournament. Close friends have their share of fun with the
            daily routine of the father and son, who does not know the fight
            between the parent wanting to give advices and he son filtering
            quite radical the input and doing to his best. You will surely
            appreciate this unusual team, two generation that get together well
            through the deep passion for bicycles.

          <h2>Adi</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Adi came into US for his Master of Arts at BU as bassoon player. He
            started working at a bike shop immediately after starting the
            school, his first visit at the store was also his first interview,
            one very unusual because the job offer was made without him asking.
            The owner who was in the store and by chance was the person Adi was
            targeting with his questions was fascinated by his knowledge and
            enthusiasm. You may guess how a foreign born student, even with
            English learned in school may face a customer exposed job in a
            bicycle store. However, a high percentage of the customers from that
            time are either friends or regular visitors even in these days.
            Adrian finished his master and has a fruitful career in music,
            worked for five years as principal bassoonist at the Mexico City
            National Orchestra, teaches on a regular basis and has concerts few
            times a week with the mandatory daily routine professional musicians
            needs to respect to keep their skills. Later, two wonderful
            daughters are competing for his care and dedication and I guess this
            time is the most intensive of his own life to this moment. And this
            to both extents, taking toll of his energy and having the most
            possible sense of fulfillment. The permanent competing priorities
            shaped Adrian's personality and he had the energy to stay on top. If
            you see him handling a bike or building the enthusiasm of an
            hesitating customer you will have a glimpse of the intensity his
            internal engine is running. Adi is speaking easily English, Spanish,
            Italian, Romanian, and, if I am not mistaken, French

          <h2>Val</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            You need to get close to see the real man behind the polite but
            restrained individual contrasting apparently with Adi's exuberance.
            You don't guess it but if you enter the store you will address him
            whatever question drove you in. And you will have the answer. In a
            heavy East European accent with German flavor, funny but with no
            challenges of understanding what he has to say. As a newcomer, you
            will miss the chance to see the funny side of him. Most common you
            will not witness an argument between the too, never serious but that
            kind who will delight close friends. The son full of enthusiasm,
            initiative, pushing forward, the father playing the skeptical, just
            for fun because in fact he is the first admirer of Adi's vitality.
            Val worked for more than 30 years as driver for the German Embassy
            in Romania, being highly professional in a very narrow niche. He had
            the job due to two rare qualities, inspiring trust and his easiness
            to learn a foreign language. If you ever tried to learn German you
            will have the right picture. Val may claim from time to time he
            would rather enjoy a glass of wine in a lazy afternoon, but in
            reality he doing something all the time. He is the person Adi needs
            and he would hardly find. Somebody to trust with both, competency
            and good will.
